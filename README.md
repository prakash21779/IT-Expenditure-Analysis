# 📊 IT Expenditure Analysis using Power BI

## 📁 Project Overview
This project involves analyzing IT expenditure across various business units, regions, and cost categories using **Power BI**. The goal is to create an interactive dashboard that provides clear insights into **actual vs. planned vs. forecasted IT costs**, highlighting overspending, underutilization, and budget alignment across departments and geographies.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- To understand how IT costs are distributed across different business functions and regions.
- To identify variances between planned, forecasted, and actual spend.
- To discover cost drivers across IT areas like labor, shared services, and planning.
- To provide actionable insights through a dashboard for strategic budgeting decisions.

---

## 🧪 Implementation Steps

### 1. 📦 Data Preparation
- Loaded multi-sheet Excel dataset into Power BI.
- Standardized field names for consistency.
- Handled missing values (e.g., blanks in actuals, forecasts).
- Converted data types for dates, amounts, and categorical variables.
- Structured the model with appropriate relationships between dimension and fact tables.

---

### 2. 💰 Cost Analysis
- Calculated total and segmented IT spend for **Actual**, **Plan**, and **Forecast** categories.
- Computed variance metrics:
  - Actual vs Plan
  - Forecast vs Plan
- Tracked trends over time and across regions or IT sub-categories.

---

### 3. 🔍 Departmental Drilldown
- Segmented cost data by:
  - IT Area
  - Business Unit
  - Cost Element Group
- Identified departments and regions with major variances.
- Compared internal labor and shared services to evaluate efficiency.

---

### 4. 📈 Dashboard & Visualization
- Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** with:
  - Slicers for region, business unit, and month
  - Bar and column charts for spend comparison
  - KPIs for total vs actual/forecast spend
  - Treemaps and pie charts for cost breakdown

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Clear visibility into which regions and departments consistently overspend.
- Cost breakdown across business functions helps identify optimization opportunities.
- Time-based trends reveal peak spending periods and forecasting accuracy.

---

## 💡 Business Value
- Supports financial decision-making with real-time, visual insights.
- Enables strategic resource allocation and rebudgeting.
- Improves accountability in cost centers by tracking performance against targets.
